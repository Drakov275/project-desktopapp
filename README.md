Interactive Calendar


Desktop app adds it self to your autostart folder and launches everytime the computer is powered on.
(Can be deleted with an app function)

The user can add a date and a specific time to the app and it will send a pop-up notification saying "The deadline is coming" and a reference to a specific time and date in the calendar chosen by the user.
